        <h2>About</h2>

        <h4 style="" class="text-left">illBePro is a free-to-use system that lets you win physical prizes for the games that you are already playing. Gamers should be able to win a pizza and have it delivered to their door for reaching in-game achievements. That's why illBePro was created. </h4>

        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
  
        <h4 class="text-left">illBePro gives you challenges and checks your real-time game stats to see who completed them. If you pick a prized challenge, illBePro attaches physical prizes to the outcome. Earn rewards for games you are already playing.</h4>

        <h2>Location based prizes</h2>
  
        <h4 class="text-left">illBePro matches you up with prizes in your local area. e.g. Domino's prizes where Domino's can deliver and Extreme Pizza prizes where Extreme Pizza can deliver. </h4>
