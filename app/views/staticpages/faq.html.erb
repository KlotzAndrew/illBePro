					<h4><strong>My area says no prizing?</strong></h4>
					<ul>
						Prizing is only available if you pick a postal code they deliver to. You can still play the challenge without prizing though! Change your postal code to see what is around you.
					</ul>
					<h4><strong>Mastery page not working?</strong></h4>
					<ul>
						Try refreshing the page and wait 1-2 minutes. Make sure League didn't put "(1)" at the end of your mastery page. (e.g. "pizza-wins (1)" instead of "pizza-wins")
					</ul>
					<h4><strong>Why does my summoner name need to be verified?</strong></h4>
					<ul>
						So we know you control the account - not 'Faker' pretending to be you.
					</ul>

					<h4><strong>Is my League account safe?</strong></h4>
					<ul>
						Yes. illBePro only needs your summoner name. Never give out your League account username and password (the credentials used to log into the League client)
					</ul>			

					<h4><strong>Is it free to use?</strong></h4>
					<ul>
						Yes! Open to everyone who plays ranked.
					</ul>

				<div id="faq_challenges" class="start-ghost">
					<h4><strong>Can I only play Corki, Olaf, Ryze, Azir?</strong></h4>
					<ul>
						Nope, play any champions. At some point you need to play a champion whose name starts with "a" (Azir, Annie Amumu, etc...) to finish spelling something like "CORA".
					</ul>	
					<h4><strong>Do I need to play in that order?</strong></h4>
					<ul>
						Nope, any order works unless otherwise stated.
					</ul>								
					<h4><strong>If I take a break, will it save my progress?</strong></h4>
					<ul>
						Yes! Progress is saved until the season ends
					</ul>
				</div>

				<h2 id="toggle_faq_prizes" class="text-left"><i id="toggle_faq_prizes_arrow" class="fa fa-arrow-right fa-1"></i> Prizes</h2>
				<div id="faq_prizes" class="start-ghost">
					<h4><strong>I only gave a postal code, how do they deliver?</strong></h4>
					<ul>
						You order or walk-in with your pizza code. Use it anytime you want.
					</ul>		

					<h4><strong>Can I actually win a pizza?</strong></h4>
					<ul>
						Yes! You get pizza codes (same as RP codes). Biggest pizza code is $20, a large pizza with delivery is $17.
					</ul>
											
					<h4><strong>Do they deliver to my house?</strong></h4>
					<ul>
						They only deliver to the postal codes the 'prized' challenges are available in. You can win pizza from anywhere.
					</ul>

					<h4><strong>When does the next season end?</strong></h4>
					<ul>
						~August 16th
					</ul>

					<h4><strong>How often can I win?</strong></h4>
					<ul>
						Max, once/week. Min, zero/season.
					</ul>												
					<h4><strong>How do get the prizes?</strong></h4>
					<ul>
						Prizes are given out Sundays, to whoever has completed a prized challenge by then. It will appear under the 'prizes' tab
					</ul>	
					<h4><strong>Why location based rewards?</strong></h4>
					<ul>
						Delivery ranges are limited. You can win from anywhere, but the delivery driver can only drive so far.
					</ul>		
					<h4><strong>Will you run out of prizes?</strong></h4>
					<ul>
						There are a fixed number of prizes for the season. A warning shows up if they are running low.
					</ul>	
					<h4><strong>Will you add prizing to my area?</strong></h4>
					<ul>
						Send us a message with your favorite restaurant and we'll see!
					</ul>
