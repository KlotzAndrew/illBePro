		<h2>FAQ</h2>
		<div>
			<h5><strong>Can I actually win a pizza?</strong></h5>
			<ul>
				Yes! The winner (highest score on Dec.7th 5:00pm EST) will get a $20 gift certificate to Dominos emailed to them (default is Canadian dollars).
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h5><strong>What if I do not live near Dominos? or live in the States?</strong></h5>
			<ul>
				No problem! A confirmation email will be sent at 5:00pm to the winner, just respond with your pizza preference and province/state.
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h5><strong>Could this auto-order and just show up at my door?</strong></h5>
			<ul>
				illBePro is not ready to handle address information right now. If you want an auto-order, put a full address in the confirmation email and the pizza will be ordered there instead of a gift certificate.
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h5><strong>Will this run every week?</strong></h5>
			<ul>
				This is a pilot test, if it goes well we will continue.
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h5><strong>This sounds too good too be true, is it?</strong></h5>
			<ul>
				This is a pilot test. The project only goes on if the pilot goes well, otherwise we just gave away a pizza for a good story about starting a website.
			</ul>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h5><strong>Will you be adding more regions?</strong></h5>
			<ul>
				Not right now. We do not have the resources for prizes in multiple regions.
			</ul>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h5><strong>Is my League account safe?</strong></h5>
			<ul>
				Yes. illBePro only needs your summoner name. Never give out your League account username and password (the credentials used to log into the League client)
			</ul>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h5><strong>Why does my summoner name need to be verified?</strong></h5>
			<ul>
				So we know it is actually you - not 'TSM WildTurtle' pretending to be you.
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h5><strong>There was a RP prize when I signed up, can I still get that?</strong></h5>
			<ul>
				If you signed up before Dec. 2nd, you can choose to get $10 RP instead of pizza.
			</ul>
